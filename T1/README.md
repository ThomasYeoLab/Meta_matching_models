# Meta-matching models for T1 data
This folder contains meta-matching models for strutral MRI T1 data

## Data
In order to use the pre-trained model, you need generate your own T1 data and use FMRIB's Linear Image Registration Tool (FLIRT) to transform the brain-extracted T1 to the FSL MNI152 standard-space T1 template with 1 mm resolution 
. If you need more details in T1 data preprocessig, you can refer to UK Biobank pipeline or HCP  preprocessing pipeline.


## Usage
Please check the detailed readme under each folder.
### `v1.0` folder
* It contains first release of the meta-matching model for T1 data.
