# Meta-matching models for rs-fMRI data
This folder contains meta-matching models for resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data

## Usage
Please check the detailed readme under each folder.
### `v1.0` folder
* It contains first release of the meta-matching model for rs_fMRI data.
### `v1.1` folder
* It contains updated release of meta-matching model for rs_fMRI data, which was trained using data after removing withdrawn participants (N=36,834) and uses normalized input functional connectivity.
### `v2.0` folder
* It contains multilayer meta-matching models (Chen et al., 2024) for rs-fMRI data, which was trained from five source datasets (with sample sizes ranging from 862 participants to 36,834 participants)
